# roomsense
Room sensor circuit using Raspberry Pi Zero, cheap sensors and hacky Python script. A bit more detail in this blog post here: https://geekwonkinterface.wordpress.com/2016/05/09/internet-of-bits-and-pieces/

ThingsSpeak dashboard for the duration of ODCamp is here: https://thingspeak.com/channels/116283. This may get taken down later so if you're interested in the data take a download now!

The circuit has been put together with leftover bits from CamJam EduKit sets and bits and pieces bought on spec from Pi Hut sales ... I'm sure there's more that can be done with it, please feel free to borrow and and improve and share.
