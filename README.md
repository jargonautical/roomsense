Room sensor circuit using Raspberry Pi Zero, cheap sensors and hacky Python script

The circuit has been put together with leftover bits from CamJam EduKit sets and bits and pieces bought on spec from Pi Hut sales ... I'm sure there's more that can be done with it, please feel free to borrow and and improve and share.
